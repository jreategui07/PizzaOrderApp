## Description

This Android application, developed with XML and Kotlin, simulates a pizza restaurant order and calculates the final price based on the selected options. Users can choose the type of pizza, the number of slices, whether they want a whole pizza, and if they need delivery. The app provides a summary of the order, including the subtotal, tax, delivery cost, and the total price. This project showcases modern Android development practices, including Data Binding and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Features

- **XML**: Used for designing the user interface.
- **Intent**: To navigate between different components of the application.
- **Binding**: For efficient and safe access to UI components.
- **Serializable**: For passing complex data structures between activities.
- **OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.
